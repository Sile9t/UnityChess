It was prictice oriented project. Made by watching videos from YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIB4s-5b9g&list=PLVn5KwrKK-CENjSzP2ei0PNUoMaerfYW1). 
The main problem was that there wasn't some logic to make figures to move and to light their movement direction, so I had to do it by myself. And i did it. 
Last video was about "how to make gaming session betweem two different players" so I did that according to those intsructions.
